 WHAT IS EditorConfig


1-EditorConfig helps maintain consistent coding styles for multiple developers working 
  on the same project across various editors and IDEs. 
2-The EditorConfig project consists of a file format for defining coding styles and 
  a collection of text editor plugins that enable editors to read the file format 
  and adhere to defined styles. 
3- EditorConfig files are easily readable and they work nicely with version control systems.
