# MERN Stack: 

MERN Stack is a Javascript Stack that is used for easier and faster deployment of full-stack web applications.

MERN Stack comprises of 4 technologies namely: MongoDB, Express, React and Node.js. It is designed to make the development process smoother and easier.

Each of these 4 powerful technologies provides an end-to-end framework for the developers to work in and each of these technologies play a big part in the development of web applications.


# MangoDB

MongoDB is a NoSQL database where each record is a document comprising of key-value pairs that are similar to JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) objects. MongoDB is flexible and allows its users to create schema, databases, tables, etc. Documents that are identifiable by a primary key make up the basic unit of MongoDB. Once MongoDB is installed, users can make use of Mongo shell as well. Mongo shell provides a JavaScript interface through which the users can interact and carry out operations (eg: querying, updating records, deleting records).

             why we use mangodb?
             {


             1-Fast – Being a document-oriented database, easy to index documents. Therefore a faster response.
             2-Scalability – Large data can be handled by dividing it into several machines.
             3-Use of JavaScript – MongoDB uses JavaScript which is the biggest advantage.
             4-Schema Less – Any type of data in a separate document.
             }

# Express
Express is a Node.js framework. Rather than writing the code using Node.js and creating loads of Node modules, Express makes it simpler and easier to write the back-end code. Express helps in designing great web applications and APIs. 
         

        why we use express?

        1-Asynchronous and Single-threaded.
        2-Effecient, fast & scalable
          Has the biggest community for Node.js
        3-Express promotes code reusability with its built-in router.
          Robust API
        4-Create a new folder to start your express project and type below command in the command prompt to initialize a package.json file. Accept the default settings and continue. 
     
# React
React is a JavaScript library that is used for building user interfaces. React is used for the development of single-page applications and mobile applications because of its ability to handle rapidly changing data. React allows users to code in JavasScript and create UI components.      


# Node.js: JS Runtime Environment 
Node.js provides a JavaScript Environment which allows the user to run their code on the server (outside the browser). Node pack manager i.e. npm allows the user to choose from thousands of free packages (node modules) to download. 

                 Why use Node.JS? 

   1- Open source JavaScript Runtime Environemnt
   2- Single threading – Follows a single threaded model.
       Data Streaming
   3- Fast – Built on Google Chrome’s JavaScript Engine, Node.js has a fast code execution.
   4- Highly Scalable
   5- Initialize a Node.js application by typing runing the below command in the command window.
