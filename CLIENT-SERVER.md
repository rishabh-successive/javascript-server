# Clients and servers
Computers connected to the web are called clients and servers.
1-clients are the typical web user's internet-connected devices.
2-servers are computers that store webpages,sites,or apps.
 # In Between this you have to go through many things they are:

    1-Your internet connection: Allows you to send and receive data on the web.

    2-TCP/IP: Transmission Control Protocol and Internet Protocol are communication protocols  that define how data should travel across the internet.

    3-DNS: Domain Name Servers are like an address book for websites. When you type a web address in your browser, the browser looks at the DNS to find the website's real address before it can retrieve the website. The browser needs to find out which server the website lives on, so it can send HTTP messages to the right place.

    4-HTTP: Hypertext Transfer Protocol is an application protocol that defines a language for clients and servers to speak to each other. 

    5-Component files: A website is made up of many different files.

          # These files come in two main types:

        Code files: Websites are built primarily from HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, though you'll meet other technologies a bit later.

        Assets: This is a collective name for all the other stuff that makes up a website, such as images, music, video, Word documents, and PDFs.

#   When you type a web address into your browser 

    1-The browser goes to the DNS server, and finds the real address of the server that the website lives on .

    2-The browser sends an HTTP request message to the server, asking it to send a copy of the website to the client. This message, and all other data sent between the client and the server, is sent across your internet connection using TCP/IP.

    3-If the server approves the client's request, the server sends the client a "200 OK" message, which means "Of course you can look at that website! Here it is", and then starts sending the website's files to the browser as a series of small chunks called data packets 

    4-The browser assembles the small chunks into a complete web page and displays it to you .
